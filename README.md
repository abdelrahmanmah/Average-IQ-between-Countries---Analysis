# Average-IQ-between-Countries-Analysis
Intelligence and Socio-Economic Indicators Analysis
This project delves into the relationship between a nation's average IQ and key socio-economic indicators. Our dataset encompasses variables such as Average IQ, Literacy Rate, Nobel Prizes, Human Development Index (HDI), Mean Years of Schooling, Gross National Income (GNI), and Population. By examining these factors, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights into the interplay between intelligence, education, and economic development globally.

## Repository Contents
- Data: The dataset used for analysis, including all relevant variables.
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the step-by-step analysis, including descriptive analysis, EDA, and predictive analysis.
- Results: Summary of findings, including visualizations and statistical outputs.
- Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, findings, and interpretations.

# Key Questions Addressed
- Highest and Lowest Average IQ by Country: Identify the countries with the highest and lowest average IQ.
- Highest and Lowest Average IQ by Continent: Determine the continents with the highest and lowest average IQ.
- Number of Nobel Prizes by Continent: Quantify the Nobel Prizes awarded to each continent.
- Most Influential Variable on Average IQ: Identify the variable most strongly correlated with average IQ.
- Correlation between Average IQ and Nobel Prizes: Explore the relationship between average IQ and the number of Nobel Prizes.

# Methodology
## Descriptive Analysis
- Summary Statistics: Generate statistics to summarize the central tendencies and dispersion of the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier Detection: Identify outliers that may affect the analysis.
- Correlation Analysis: Assess relationships between variables using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
- Variable Distributions: Examine the distributions of key variables.
- Geographical Analysis: Use maps to visualize regional disparities.
- Scatter Matrix: Plot scatter matrices to observe potential relationships.
## Predictive Analysis
- Linear Models: Develop simple and multiple linear regression models to predict Average IQ.
- Model Assumptions and Transformations: Check assumptions and perform necessary data transformations.
- ANOVA Test: Use analysis of variance to understand the influence of categorical variables.
- Outlier Detection: Detect and handle outliers to ensure robust models.

# Analysis Findings

- Most Influential Variable on Average IQ: Determine which socio-economic variable most significantly impacts average IQ. The most influential factor identified is the Human Development Index (HDI).

- Correlation between Average IQ and Nobel Prizes: Examine if a higher average IQ is associated with a greater number of Nobel Prizes.

# Conclusion
We concluded that the most influential factor in determining average IQ is the Human Development Index (HDI). HDI is a composite index measuring a country's average achievements in three basic dimensions of human development:

- Health: Measured by life expectancy at birth.
- Education: Measured by mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
- Standard of Living: Measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).
